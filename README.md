This is a python file that can be run directly on the interpreter.
This program parses a string into dictionary format, in which the contents are nested by dictionary structure and array structure.
The outermost layer is the dictionary structure, and the inner sub_ Fund is an array structure. The data will fill the array in the form of a dictionary, and some of the data is a string array.
The amount of data varies, and the program is universal.
